## The instructions, from `master`, have been modified.
Do the following to run:
  1. ~~Verify that NPM is installed on your machine by running `npm -v`.~~
  2. ~~Travel to the root folder.~~
  3. ~~Type `npm install`.~~
  4. ~~Type `npm start`.~~
  5. ~~Head to `localhost:8080`.~~
  6. Search for information and clear one result (or all results).
  7. Enjoy!

## This branch, `gh-pages`, is for demonstration purposes. Some of the code from `master` has not been carried over so that `gh-pages` will be served properly. In other words, head to [Fun with Wiki](https://feedthemind.github.io/funWithWiki)!
